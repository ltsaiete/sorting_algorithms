# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
